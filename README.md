# Tour with Full Programming Hero Website 🌐

Welcome to my mini project **"Tour with Full Programming Hero Website"**!  
This project contains 3 linked web pages designed with HTML & CSS.  
Each page is created with attention to design, responsiveness, and functionality.

## 🔗 Live Pages (Locally Designed)
- `index.html` – Main Landing Page
- `class.html` – Class Details Page
- `tour-mami.html` – Tour Details Page

> **Note:** These pages are developed for local use and previewed via `localhost`.
